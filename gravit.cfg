# Gravit Configuration file
#
# This is the config file for gravit! These commands can be executed in Gravit via the console.
# I've done my best to make these default settings be as compatible as possible.
#
# * Note: Make sure you read the comment on particlerendermode...
#
# Feel free to make changes to this file, or create your own called custom.cfg so the tgz/zip
# doesn't overwrite it -- It gets called from this file automatically.
#
# If you're feeling lucky and want to jump right in to it, uncomment "exec demo.cfg" on the bottom of this file.
#

# Memory Avaiable
#   This is the amount of memory in MB Gravit will use to store particle history.

# Particle Render Mode
#
#	There are 3 ways of rendering particles. The first mode (0) just renders dots that are
#	only one pixel wide. The second mode (1) is a fast way of rendering nice looking particles
#   but it may not work on everyone's system. The third mode (2) makes your particles look
#   cool and is more compatible.

# Redrawing Video while recording (new in 0.2.1)
#   This allows you to move around while a frame is being recorded. It stops the 'lag' problem.
#   Setting this to 0 will disable it for maximum recording speed.
#   The value is how often you want your video to update in milliseconds.
#   Setting this value too low will lower the performance of your recording
#   Increasing it will improve rendering and spawning times

# Font Settings (doesn't work while Gravit is running)
#   Feel free to use any font you want!

# Colours (new in 0.2.1)
#   You can customise the colour scheme/spectrum.
#   Colours are Red/Green/Blue/Alpha from 0 to 1. Only one tab or space is allowed between each number.
#   The first colour added is the lowest value.

# Draw Colour Scheme
#   This draws the little bar on the top right. Useful for galaxy colour reference and testing
#   your new colour scheme.

# Tail Settings
#   You can add and customise cool tails for particles.
#   All of these can be configured inside Gravit using the bottom row of keys. Press F2 for the keys.
# taillength: The maximum length of each tail. Set this to -1 for infinite!
# tailwidth: The width of each tail. default is 1.
# tailfaded: Set this to 1 if you want tails to be gradually more transparent over the length of each tail.
# tailopacity: Sets the maximum opacity of each tail
# tailskip: Used for video performace, the higher the value the uglier it looks, but it renders faster.

# Particle Spawning Settings
#   This determines what kind of inital positions and properties your particles have.
#   The settings below reflect the defaults.
#
# Number of particles to spawn
# particlecount 1000
#
# Number of rendering threads (auto-detected; only use this option if you want to use fewer threads) 
# processors 2
#
# Example
# Uncomment the following line to make Gravit start recording automatically with nice looking settings
# exec demo.cfg

# Custom Script
exec custom.cfg ignoremissing
