ZLIB DATA COMPRESSION LIBRARY

  version 1.2.5, April 19th, 2010

  Copyright (C) 1995-2010 Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler


zlib 1.2.x is a general purpose data compression library.  All the code is
thread safe.  The data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs
(Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt (zlib format), rfc1951.txt (deflate format)
and rfc1952.txt (gzip format).

All functions of the compression library are documented in the file zlib.h
(volunteer to write man pages welcome, contact zlib@gzip.org).  Two compiled
examples are distributed in this package, example and minigzip.  The example_d
and minigzip_d flavors validate that the zlib1.dll file is working correctly.

Questions about zlib should be sent to <zlib@gzip.org>.  The zlib home page
is http://zlib.net/ .  Before reporting a problem, please check this site to
verify that you have the latest version of zlib; otherwise get the latest
version and check whether the problem still exists or not.

PLEASE read DLL_FAQ.txt, and the the zlib FAQ http://zlib.net/zlib_faq.html
before asking for help.


Acknowledgments:

The deflate format used by zlib was defined by Phil Katz.  The deflate and
zlib specifications were written by L.  Peter Deutsch.  Thanks to all the
people who reported problems and suggested various improvements in zlib; they
are too numerous to cite here.
