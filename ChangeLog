Gravit ChangeLog

    http://gravit.slowchop.com/

0.4.1 2005/06/08

    * Stereoscopic mode uses degrees instead of a distance and keeps the simulation in the middle of your view
    * autoconf uses sdl-config
    * Added a vim syntax highlighting and tabstop setting to the top of all .gravitspawn files
    * Fixed an endless loop in dust.gravitspawn
    * Slightly modified dust.gravitspawn to sometimes only have one particle in the center of the dust cloud
    * Less significant figures shown for colorschemeadd
    * More significant figures shown when setting g
    * g is now a float
    * osd displays frameskip with display frame in playback
    * Fixed a bug when frameskip is on, spawning a new simulation caused the simulation to display incorrectly
    * Added negative mass colour key and the colour key is thinner
    * Added "zoomfitauto 2" to autofit every frame ("zoomfitauto 1" is still default)
    * Added original Makefile (Makefile.old) to source distribution
    * Increased initial velocities in many-galaxy.spawnparticles 

0.4.0 2005/05/31

    * Added an optional dependency - lua
    * Scriptable spawn locations using lua
          o The spawn command accepts an argument that executes a lua script called [name].gravitspawn in your spawn directory
          o spawn by itself will execute default.gravitspawn which picks a random script
          o Added spawn scripts: one-galaxy, binary-galaxy, many-galaxy, dust, snake, loop
          o binary-galaxy and many-galaxy will randomly spawn elliptical and spiral galaxies
          o Spiral galaxies now spawn on arbitrary angles 
    * frameskip accepts negative values to play back in slow motion
          o the negative number represents how many video frames display each recorded frame
          o particles are interpolated between frames 
    * Gravit now uses autoconf and automake (Thanks Alec Thomas)
          o It now stores data and config files in configured places (/usr/local/bin,/usr/local/share/gravit,/etc) 
    * Supports multiple users for UNIX builds
    * Removed gravit-x.x.x-win32.zip package
    * Renamed gravit-x.x.x-src.tgz package to gravit-x.x.x.tar.gz
    * recordingvideorefreshtime in gravit.cfg is now 100
    * Added two colour schemes: momentum and kinetic energy (Thanks Sam Lander)
    * Colours are only updated once per frame and when changing colour modes
    * Added zoomfix and zoomfitauto to automatically zoom in or out to fit all the particles on the screen (zoomfitauto is on by default)
    * When two particles spawned in the same location gravit crashes on the first frame. Particles now get checked and moved on spawn.
    * When the GL_ARB_point_parameters and GL_ARB_point_sprite extensions don't work, default to particlemode 2 instead of 0
    * saveauto stopped saving after it reached max frames -- fixed
    * "Can't load custom.cfg" warning gone -- if it's not there it's ignored using "ignoremissing" 

0.3.2 2005/04/15

    * fixed compilation on Mac OS X (Thanks Grigory Entin!)
    * added help command for help
    * added list command to list all available console commands
    * added savelist to list all saved simulations
    * added savedelete to delete a simulation
    * more keys can be typed in the console
    * console key repeat is now on (holding down a key to print multiple keys)
    * console typed history, pressing up and down will scroll through your typed history
    * console left and right keys will move the cursor around
    * help console messages are now blue
    * "G" set message is gone 

0.3.1 2005/04/13

    * Added recording statistics that display percentage completed for generating the tree and adding velocities.
    * Added particlerendermode 2 which is more compatible and looks like particlerendermode 1, but about half as slow (on my pc at least).
    * particlerendermode is set to 2 by default.
    * Added videorestart command -- restarts your video after changing video settings such as resolution or fullscreen.
    * videowidth and videoheight won't change the gui until you do a videorestart
    * Alt-Enter switches between fullscreen and not (buggy?)
    * Added timers: timeradd, timerdel, timerlist
    * Particles spawn faster with many particles
    * Galaxies are spawned a little differently. Their height is 100th of the radius and their individual velocities are faster within the galaxy.
    * Added maxvertices setting that automatically increases tailskip when too many things are being rendered
    * tailskip is now set to 1 by default
    * Tree renders correctly with stereo mode on
    * Added autorecord to start recording after spawning particles.
    * Major revamp of screensaver.cfg using timers
    * Added popuptext command, not useful (yet!) :)
    * Added autocenter command to automatically go to the 'middle' of the simulation (it's on by default)
    * Simulation name is cleared when spawning a new simulation
    * /CP was meant to be /C for screensaver code 

0.3.0 2005/04/11

    * Windows Installer package added
    * Windows DLL Zip package removed
    * Windows Screensaver added
          o Install it by running the "installscreensaver" command
          o You need the SDL libraries in your Windows System directory for the screensaver to work (the Windows Installer does this for you)
          o The Gravit makes use of the Windows registry to help the screensaver know where it is installed. It is saved on a per-user basis.
          o Modify screensaver.cfg to customise your screen saver.
          o You can hit the space bar during the screen saver to use Gravit. 
    * Added stereo/stereoseparation commands! (Careful, these make your eyes hurt)
          o This draws two versions of the simulation on the left and right side of the screen.
          o Have a read of http://www.angelfire.com/ca/erker/freeview.html to work out what your eyes can do... then,
          o Set stereoseparation to be negative for a "Parallel" stereo view or positive for "Cross-eyed" view.
          o The bigger the stereoseparation the more depth you will see.
          o For best results:
                + try to use the cross view method (have stereoseparation positive, 500 works good for me)
                + turn off the on-screen display (drawosd 0)
                + be as zoomed in as possible
                + try all the effects! 
    * g command added, for changing G in the F=G*m1*m2/d^2 calculation.
          o The value you get out of setting g is "10 ^ -g". Default is 5 (0.00001). The screensaver uses 4 (0.0001).
          o The lower the number the less accurate the simulation is, but each particle moves quicker per frame. 
    * Added saveauto command to automatically save every n frames. Set it to 0 to turn it off.
    * autorotate command added, for automatically rotating the camera. It was implemented primarily for the screensaver.
    * Added zoom command. This is the variable you change when you zoom in and out.
    * showcursor command added, hides or shows the mouse cursor
    * Got rid of --exec. See --help!
    * Got rid of some redundant matrix code
    * Fixed mouse input oddness
    * Mouse isn't stuck inside your window anymore
    * Fixed bug in recordingvideorefreshtime. When set to 0 it would the screen as fast as possible (instead of once every finished recorded frame).
    * Few spellings of the old name 'Graviton' fixed 

0.2.2 2005/04/09

    * load and save commands added
          o usage is save [simulationname] or load [simulationname]
          o name doesn't require an extension - they're made for you in the save directory.
          o if you don't specify simulation name, it will use the last name you used in a load or save command (if you have used one)
          o control-s is a shortcut to save to the simulation
          o the current simulation name is displayed on the top of the screen 
    * Better (?) mouse controls. You need to hold down a mouse button to rotate the view. This seems to be useful in non-fullscreen mode.
    * Mousewheel up/down zooms in/out
    * Added command-line parsing
          o --help/--version self expanatory
          o --execute to execute a command
          o --noscript to not run gravit.cfg on startup 
    * Colour scheme bar is thinner
    * Colour scheme bar can be turned off with "drawcolourscheme 0"
    * Gravit now quits when the user hits the X in their WM
    * Less alloc debug messages
    * Compiling a console only binary works again (using -DNO_GUI) 

0.2.1 2005/04/08

    * Added recordingvideorefreshtime command to allow Gravit to render to the screen while recording a frame or spawning particles.
          o This makes your FPS smoother during a recording.
          o Also allows you to restart the spawn process while spawning lots of particles.
          o With a lot of particles, you can see the octtree being generated!!
          o See gravit.cfg for more details... 
    * Added colourschemenew and colourschemeadd commands to allow you to customise the colour scheme
    * Recording is now about twice as fast due to an inefficient distance calculation. (Thanks to Michael Vanslembrouck for pointing that out)
    * Window Title now tells the status of your recording. For example "17/2532 (skip:16)" means 17 frames recorded our of a 2532 maximum with a record skip of 16.
    * spawning galaxy sizes fixed
    * grativ.cfg sets videobpp to 32 now, instead of 16.
    * Windows zip's have renamed files to ChangeLog.txt and README.txt 

0.2 2005/04/07

    * Added SDL_image as a dependency
    * Added a second help menu (F2)
    * Added blendmode command which has 5 blending modes (L key)
    * Added demo.cfg to distribution (woops)
    * Added sprite particle effects!
          o It is on by default and uses the GL_ARB_point_parameters and GL_ARB_point_sprite extensions.
          o Unfortunately these extensions may not work under certain conditions. Turning particlerendermode to 0 will make particles visible again.
          o It will fall back to the original GL_POINT renderer if your card does not support them. It will also tell you that it has done this.
          o Added particle.png
                + To modify it, save it as a transparent 24bit png.
                + If you modify it and it looks cool send it my way! 
    * Added particlerendermode command (0=original 1=sprites) ( \ Key )
    * Added particlesizemin ( Keys: - = ) and particlesizemax ( Keys: [ ] ) commands to change the size of your particles.
          o When you're in particlerendermode 0 only particlesizemin applies 
    * Added drawtree command which displays the last generated Oct Tree (T key)
          o There are three modes: 0 off, 1 lines, 2 boxes
          o leaf nodes are highlighted 
    * Added screenshot and screenshotloop commands, they are also bound to F9 and F10. They create (many) BMP files.
          o This will make a screenshots directory for you.
          o Careful! F10 takes a screenshot every frame! 
    * Added a new colour mode: Acceleration!
    * Colour modes can be changed with the / key.
    * Console can now be escaped by pressing escape, backtick (`) and hitting enter on an empty command
    * Console cursor blinking is now based on time instead of frames
    * Console input box is a little more obvious when active
    * Added drawosd command which can hide the text ( O key )
    * If initializing video fails, it will try change some settings for you and try again.
    * All text files are saved in UNIX file format
    * README, ChangeLog and config files are now in Windows format in the Windows packages
    * Fixed permissions in tarball to 644
    * Fixed library include path (/usr/X11R6/lib) issue (Alec)
    * tailskip variable caused an infinitle loop when set to 0 (fixed)
    * Many Makefile changes
    * Added an icon!
    * Thanks to Alec Thomas for Linux testing and code fixes! 

0.1 2005/04/04

    * Initial Release
