# This script gets executed when gravit is run as a screensaver. Gravit will not run gravit.cfg!!
# To install gravit as a screensaver just type in "installscreensaver" into the console

# execute gravit.cfg because it won't run by iteself
exec gravit.cfg

# g is set lower then normal for 'speed'
# The lower this number is, the less accurate it is. But that's ok, it's a screensaver.
